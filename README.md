## <span style="color:blue">Overview and Origin</span>


**Company:** [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/)

**Industry:** Robo-Advising, Personal Finance, Retirement and Wealth Management

**Incorporation:** In 2008 as KaChing

**Founders:** Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll

**Birth of Wealthfront (KaChing):** The 2008 Financial Crash brought the two founders together to explore solutions to democratize access to sophisticated financial advice. Andy, at the time, was a successful Co-Founder of Benchmark Capital, VC Firm. He was teaching at Stanford and sitting on the University Of Pennsylvania Board Of Trustees. During his tenure, he would often receive questions about investment advices. He could not recommend the product or service he was using because of high minimum requirements. That is when he realized there is a need for everyone to have access to financial investment advices and technology would make it easier for people.
</b>

Dan was in a different situation. His parents were experiencing the impact of the 2008 Financial Crash. The financial advisor that his parents hired could not help them weather the crash. Therefore, he was determined to find a solution to provide good financial advices to the people who are in the same situation as his parents. 

Andy and Dan met after many cold calls. In the meeting, they formed KaChing (Wealthfront) on a vision to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice and agreed that software is the mechanism to analyze and deliver it to customers.


 **Funding:** Wealthfront raised $274.2 Millions over 7 rounds from Angel to Series E and Convertible Note.
