## <span style="color:blue">Overview and Origin</span>


**Company:** [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/)

**Industry:** Robo-Advising, Personal Finance, Retirement and Wealth Management

**Incorporation:** In 2008 as KaChing

**Founders:** Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll

**Birth of Wealthfront (KaChing):** The 2008 financial crash brought the two founders to explore solutions around democratizing access to sophisticated financial advice. Andy, was a co-founder of Benchmark Capital, a successful VC Firm. He was also teaching at Stanford and on the Board of Trustees for the University Of Pennsylvania. During his tenure, he received questions for investment advice. He could not recommend the product or service he was using because of high minimum requirements. That was when he realized the need for everyone to have access to financial investment advice and technology. </br>

Dan was in a different situation. His parents were experiencing the impact of the 2008 financial crash. The financial advisor that his parents hired could not help them weather the crash. Therefore, he was determined to find a solution to provide financial advice to the people who were in the same situation as his parents. </br>

After many cold calls, Andy and Dan met. In their meeting, they formed KaChing (Wealthfront) with a vision to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice. They agreed that software was the mechanism to analyze and deliver it to their customers.

 **Funding:** Wealthfront raised $274.2 Millions over 7 rounds.

## <span style="color:blue">Landscape:</span>

**Financial Industry Domain:** Robo-Advisor

**Major Trends Over the Last 5 to 10 years:** There are four major trends and innovations that emerged over the last five years:
1.	Banks are entering into the FinTech Robo-advisor market. Prominent Banks such as Blackrock and UBS are acquiring or collaborating with FinTech companies and startups.
2.	Financial Institutions are creating their proprietary Robo-Advisors and offering it to the existing clients. 
3.	Existing FinTech companies such as Betterment and WealthFront are expanding Products and Services into the traditional banking service. Betterment, SoFI and Acorns are offering checking accounts with debit card. Wealthfront, Betterment, Personal Capital and SoFi are offering saving accounts. In addition, they are exploring the integration of people spending habit and long term investment –concept of “Self-Driving Money”. The Self-Driving Money is a budgeting tool that automate pay bills and direct the money to different accounts based on defined financial goals.
4.	Financial Institutions and FinTech companies are launching products in area of retirement income strategies. The products focus on retiree spending and drawing down the accounts in a tax efficient approach.

Overall, WealthFront is one of the top Robo-Advisors in the US. 

## <span style="color:blue">Recommendations:</span> 

I recommend that WealthFront expand their product offering to Fine Art and/or Art Tokens. The Artprice 100 index is the blue chip Art Market index that tracks the top 100 important artists and their average performances over the previous five years. This would be an alternative investment product. In 2021, the Artprice 100 Index showed that return is up 36% compared to S&P500.

Fine Art and Digital Token Art would be beneficial to WealthFront because the alternative investment does not correlate to the stock market and would expose more Millennial and Generation Z to fine and digital arts. It is an opportunity to bring in additional revenue for WealthFront. 

There are few of existing online auctioneers that WealthFront can collaborate to implement the product offering like [Masterworks](https://www.masterworks.io/), [Rallyrd](https://rallyrd.com/), [Lot-Art](https://www.lot-art.com/), and [TokenArts](https://www.tokenarts.io/). The technology requirements will be integration with the auctioneer’s technology stack. For example, if WealthFront partners with [Masterworks](https://www.masterworks.io/), they would build an integration with Apache http server and Laravel. It will allow them to route the investment made by WealthFront consumers.

By building a bridge between alternative investment and robo-advising, WealthFront can forge a new niche in the FinTech Industry.
